====== Tags ======

This plugin adds a tag cloud and a page index organized by tags in the side pane. 

The tag cloud allows toggling the selection of tags that is shown in the page index. The page index can be switched between a flat view, showing all pages that match the filtering criteria, and an ordered view that shows known tags as the top level nodes with pages beneath them.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

===== Options =====
The option **Position in the window** determines in which side pane the tag list is shown.
