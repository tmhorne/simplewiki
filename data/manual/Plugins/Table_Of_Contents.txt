====== Table Of Contents ======

This plugin adds a widget with a Table Of Contents for the current page. It can be either in the side pane or "floating" on top of the page. The Table Of Contents gives an outline of all headings in the page, and allows modifying this outline (try the context menu).

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

===== Options =====
The option **Position in the window** determines in which side pane the table is shown.

Alternatively if the option **Show ToC as floating widget instead of in sidepane** is enabled the table is shown on top of the page view.

 By default the page title is not show in the table of contents (unless there are multiple title headings in the page). If the option **Show the page title heading in the ToC** is enabled the page title will always been shown in the table of contents.
