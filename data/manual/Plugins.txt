If one or more dependencies of a plugin are not fulfilled, these are marked red.

===== Installing Plugins =====
If a plugin is distributed as a separate python module, it should be installed such that zim can find it. For use specific plugins you can install them Python's "per user site-package directory".

For example for python 2.6 this folder is:
Unix (including Mac OS X): ''~/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages''
Windows: ''%APPDATA%/Python/Python26/site-packages''

See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/ for details.

===== Writing Plugins =====
If you are looking for information on **writing plugins** please download the source package and have a look at the module documentation of the "''zim.plugins''" python module.
