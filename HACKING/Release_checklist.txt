====== Release checklist ======

Preliminary:
* Go over all bugs in the tracker to check if status is still correct, any new patches are attached
* Also check bugs in the debian bug tracker
* Announce to mailing list what day the release will be, so translaters can update their translations

**Don't allow any last minute patches on the same day as the release -- stupid mistakes will happen and force a bug fix release the next day.**

Merge translations:
* Request download from launchpad
* Merge it with ''tools/import-launchpad-translations.py''

Prepare the package:
* Set version in ''zim/__init__.py''
* Update CHANGELOG.txt -- see `''bzr visualize''` for changes
* Update debian changes -- run e.g. `''debchange -v 0.46''`
* Optionally merge branch with website updates since previous release
* Update version number in website downloads page

Check the package:
* `''./setup.py sdist''` (updates meta data etc.)
* `make builddeb` and check `''lintian -Ivi ../zim_0.46_i386.changes''`
* Test website with ./tools/test_website.py
* Run `''make clean''` and check `''bzr st''` for any remaining build files

Finalize the revision:
* run ''./test.py'' for the last time

* commit + tag + push

Build release packages:
* `''./setup.py sdist''` (updates meta data etc.)
* `''make builddeb''` + `''make clean''`
