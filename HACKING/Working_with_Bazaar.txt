====== Working with Bazaar ======

The zim code is kept under version control using the bazaar version control system. See the website for documentation on using this system: http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/

The quick course, to get a copy of the zim code:

	bzr branch lp:zim

To check in some changes (don't forget to give some meaningful changelog)

	bzr add
	bzr commit


To create a patch that can be mailed:

	bzr send -o some-description.patch

Alternatively you can publish your branch directly on the launchpad website and file a merge proposal.
